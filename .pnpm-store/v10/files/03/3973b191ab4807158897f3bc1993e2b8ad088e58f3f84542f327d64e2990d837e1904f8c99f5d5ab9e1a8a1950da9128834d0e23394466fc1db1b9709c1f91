/**
 * Combines all relevant setting values into a final configuration to be used for spell checking.
 * It applies any overrides and appropriate language settings by taking into account the document type (languageId)
 * the locale (natural language) and any in document settings.
 *
 * Note: this method will not search for configuration files. Configuration files should already be merged into `settings`.
 * It is NOT necessary to include the cspell defaultSettings or globalSettings. They will be applied within this function.
 * @param document - The document to be spell checked. Note: if the URI doesn't have a path, overrides cannot be applied.
 *   `locale` - if defined will be used unless it is overridden by an in-document setting.
 *   `languageId` - if defined will be used to select appropriate file type dictionaries.
 * @param settings - The near final settings. Should already be the combination of all configuration files.
